# Billing Issues
If you notice unexpected charges, verify them under **Account > Billing History**.
If a charge seems incorrect:
1. Check if you recently upgraded a subscription or purchased an add-on.
2. Look for any family or team accounts linked to yours.
3. Contact billing support within 14 days for investigation.

Invoices are available in PDF format and can be downloaded from the same page.
